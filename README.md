# rasPeri.sh
Use your [rasp0w](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) to perish ...or disconnect users from their networks

Be careful, this script is *explicitly* made for **Raspberry Pi Zero W** and uses the ARM version of [Kali Linux Rpi0w Nexmon](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-arm-images/#1493408272250-e17e9049-9ce8).

It uses the **aircrack-ng** suite and assumes you are root.

## How to use it

Give the script execute permissions
> chmod +x rasperi.sh

Navigate to script's folder, run it as follows and complete the setup
> ./rasperi.sh

If you want to use it headless, enable auto-login, so that attacks work automatically on boot, without user interaction.
